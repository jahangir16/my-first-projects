<h1>Animal:</h1>
<p>
    Animals (also called <em>Metazoa</em>) are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms in the biological kingdom 
    Animalia.With few exceptions, animals consume organic material, breathe oxygen, are able to move, 
    can reproduce sexually, and go through an ontogenetic stage in which their body consists of a 
    hollow sphere of cells, the blastula, during embryonic development. Over 1.5 million living animal
    species have been described—of which around 1 million are insects—but it has been estimated there
    are over 7 million animal species in total. Animals range in length from <strong> 8.5 micrometres 
    (0.00033 in) to 33.6 metres (110 ft)</strong>. They have complex interactions with each other and their
    environments, forming intricate food webs. The scientific study of animals is known as zoology.
